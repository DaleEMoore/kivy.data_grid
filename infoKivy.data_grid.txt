    Okay, relief. Yes, the binary installer for Kivy seems broken on 17.10.
    Luckily, you can get it working if you build from source.
    So, follow the instruction here for 16.04:
        https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html#installation-devel
    But leave out
        python-gst0.10
        gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
    from the dependencies.
    This might have helped:
    sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools python-pygame python3-opengl   python3-enchant python3-dev build-essential python3-pip libgl1-mesa-dev   libgles2-mesa-dev zlib1g-dev

    Went back to Ubuntu 16.04!
    It's no better. Still fails on the GUI.
    Damn it!





I couldn't get kivy running on PC JenOvo.
    It looked like cython, kivy versions.
    I've got it working by downgrading from Ubuntu 17.10 to 16.04.
    I MIGHT be able to get 17.10 working... I should do it in a VM first!
        And document it!
    Got the VM running at JenOvo and QnD. Now keep.google.com document it.

Take modal_insert() and make a modal_update(data).

Fix UPDATE to work.
Point data at sqlite DB.
Accept any sqlite table and adapt the code to work with that table.

Is this a good MVC base?
    This looks GREAT!

What's wrong with the UPDATE button, it does nothing?
    upt_row_btn, nothing attached to it's on_press event.
    There's another update - or is it add row that gets a screen that could be used for update...
    Add custonm row, insert.
    add_custom_row = Button(text="Add Custom Row", on_press=modal_insert)
Take modal_insert() and make a modal_update(data).
I wonder if somebody else already did it...
